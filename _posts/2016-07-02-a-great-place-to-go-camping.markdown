I recently had the opportunity to visit a great camping spot ‚õ∫. The place is called Lac Poisson Blanc and for those of you who may be interested here are some details about the weekend. 

First of all, this lake is accessible through the south and the north parts of the lake. There are no dwellings on the shores of this lake which makes it a perfect place to find peace and quiet! It's unlike those overpopulated lakes you'll find in Quebec if you know what I mean. You may reserve your spot or take a chance and go look for a designated free campsite. You will need a canoe and to be ready for a few hours of paddling, piece of cake!

If you are coming from Ottawa I suggest parking and renting your canoes at [Camp Air Eau Bois](http://www.aireaubois.com/fr/services  "Camp Air Eau Bois"), which is much closer (1h drive).

Once you get to your campsite you'll notice the quiet surounding you. The forest is deep and thick. Luckily the Reserve Faunique du Lac Poisson Blanc folks have left most campsites with a picnic table and an outhouse. So you won't feel like your stepping in someones üí© or like you're eating where you üí©. If you made official reservations, a parc ranger will visit your campsite to offer firewood üî• and ice ‚ùÑÔ∏è. As well, he will offer to deliver these goodies again the next day if you need them. 

We were quite happy with our weekend, our campsite was beside a huge cliff, it had really nice water access, perfect for swimming. We had big bon fires and ate lots of food! I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did and I hope to bring my dog next time!
