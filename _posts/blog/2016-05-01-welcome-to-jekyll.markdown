This is my new blog! It is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) which is a static site generator. If you aren't familiar with Jekyll, check out this [article](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) from Jonathan McGlone which will get you started. If you are like me you will love Jekyll for how easy it is to maintain. This blog is meant to be simple and easy to read. I will be writing about the things I do and work on mostly. Thanks for visiting and hope you'll enjoy the read.
