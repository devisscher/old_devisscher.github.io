Have you ever found yourself in a collab project and realized your teammates are not headed in the same direction as you? Maybe their objectives are different, their way of doing things is different or even their idea of project ownership is different. 

I recently found myself in such a situation while working on a community project. I love getting involved in development projects because I get to meet people who love to discuss the things I love. (e.g. coding) Things can get a little complicated when you can't agree on the direction a project should take. Following this experience, I thought it would be helpful to write down some of the things I've learned about collaborating.

<h3>1. Use a common repo.</h3>
All too often tension arises when your code repo isn't under your GitHub account. My feeling with regards to who should own the repo is, nobody. That's right, use an organization that is happy to host your repo. If you met in a public meet-up, ask the organizers of that meet-up if you can host your project on their GitHub account. This will ease the tension created by code ownership and provide great visibility to your meet-up group.

<h3>2. Be wary of scope creep.</h3>
When you start a collaborative project you might find yourself overwhelmed by its scope. Collaborative projects usually bring many people together from different backgrounds. Even though the idea of building an app that can do anything and everything might be interesting, most people who join your project will not have time to wrap their heads around the entirety of your project's scope. Keep things simple and succinct. Make sure you attack specific problems and address solutions quickly. If you have the time to meet with your teammates, discuss tasks and features and make up a list of priorities quickly. Don't deliberate endlessly, people soon get annoyed and 
lose track.

<h3>3. Keep money out of the picture.</h3>
Nowadays, the most expensive part of developing apps is time. People have limited amounts of time, let alone time to spend on collaborative side projects. When discussing with your teammates, don't talk about money. We all want to build a best-seller app which will bring in millions of dollars. But be aware that joining a collaborative project isn't solely motivated by money. Friendships, knowledge and networking are also great motivators.  Also, keep in mind that some participants may be bound by their employers and profit would interfere with their current engagements. Remember that profit comes with liabilities.

<h3>4. Limit pseudocode.</h3>
You might find it fun to blurt out functions and write out code as if the project needed to be done today. But you'll end up making your teammates pull their hair out. Write code that works. Spend more time on one function and make sure it works. Now, I'm not saying you need to use TDD religiously, but at least make sure every time you write some code, you can safely commit it without breaking the app. If and when you do commit code that breaks the app, let your teammates know so they don't end up scratching their heads next time they work on the project.

<h3>5. Don't start with proprietary BS.</h3>
Let's face it, most of the code you write has already been written. Also, many famous apps are open source and are capable of generating profits, so why would you feel the need to close off your code. If you feel the need to make your code closed source, don't join collaborative projects. Tying in to #1, you should also include an MIT or BSD license in your repo. This way you avoid the proprietary BS discussion. We can all think of a company who favored proprietary code over open source...

<h3>Conclusion</h3> 

The reason why some of these dos and don'ts are important is that the success of your project is "bigly" related to the people who work with you. Inclusiveness and making sure everyone is comfortable with the scope and direction of the project will create a more enjoyable experience for collaborative projects. This list is non-exhaustive and I would love to hear about your collaborative experiences and what you've found.
