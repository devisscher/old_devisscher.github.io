You can easily use Sublime over ssh with the help of rsub. 

First install rsub package in sublime. ``` ctrl + shift + p ``` and search ```rsub```. Then go to your terminal on your local machine and open your ssh config ``` nano ~/.ssh/config ```. Inside of it, add the following block.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/devisscher/97ff9fa31d1adbda9543742855370d59.js"></script>

Save that file and now ssh into your remote server to install rsub/rmate.

``` sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/rsub https://raw.github.com/aurora/rmate/master/rmate ```

Make the script you just downloaded executable:

``` sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rsub ```

Now when you want to edit a file at your server you can simply type: 

``` rsub ~/home/my-project/my-file.html ```

Works like a charm and you get to use Sublime instead of Nano or Vim. ðŸ˜†
