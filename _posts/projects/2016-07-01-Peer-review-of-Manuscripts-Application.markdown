This application was built to allow researchers to exchange manuscripts for peer review during the presubmission phase of their research. They required a platform from which the administrator could create questionnaires and assign these to manuscripts which were submitted by users. This allows the organization to provide valuable feedback with a standardized approach.

Technologies used:

- ASP.NET
- JavaScript
