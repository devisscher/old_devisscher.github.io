> "I AM not about to write a dedication, nor do I solicit protection for this work. It will be read, if it is good; and if it is bad, I am not anxious that it should be read.
>  
> I have issued these first letters in order to gauge the public taste; in my portfolio I have a goodly number more which I may 
> hereafter publish.
>
> This, however, depends upon my remaining unknown: let my name once be published and I cease to write. I know a lady who walks well 
> enough, but who limps if she is watched. Surely the blemishes of my book are sufficient to make it needless that I should submit 
> those 
> of my person to the critics. Were I known, it would be said, “His book is at odds with his character; he might have employed his time 
> to better purpose; it is not worthy of a serious man.” Critics are never at a loss for such remarks, because there goes no great 
> expense of brains to the making of them."
