Over time ideologies change to better reflect the minds and ideas of those who live in the present. However, I've found the ideology Libralism to be convoluted in definition. Many people have different opinions on what liberalism is. I will outline those I have encountered.

#### 1. The LPC liberal

In Canada this is the most comon liberal. 

#### 2. The classical liberal

The classical liberal builds his understanding of the ideology from the classics. He is inspired by the likes of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean Jacques Rousseau, etc etc. He stauchly belives in the inalienable rights that we all have. In a sense these liberals are more right winged than left, more conservative than progressive. 

#### 3. The neo-liberal

Of all the liberals this might be the most controversial. They prone devolution and wish to govern in small amounts, dreading centralized powers. They are usually socialists enemies. I recall Chavez speaking of neo-liberalism with great passion. Passion so strong he promises to never let it take over.

#### 4. The social liberal

The social liberal evolved from the classical liberal, during the keynesien era of american history(Post ww2), a new kind of liberalism appears. Not only does it garantee the inalienable rights we have, the government is also to take charge of services which serve the needy. This liberal has become much more progressive and is leaning towards the center.

#### 5. The libtard

The libtard is a satyrical blunder of distastful origin. It refers to those liberals that live in a fantasy world. Just by writing the term down I loose all credibility, however the commical and absurd style seeked is an important addition to the meaning. You might recall the Familly Guy episode where Stewie calls Brian a *******.
