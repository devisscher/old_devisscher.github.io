Welcome to Tom Devisscherâ€™s website. This is his little corner of the world wide web. You will find a collection of notes, articles, thoughts, and projects that he has worked on.

Tom is the type of guy that loves to apply himself to the nitty gritty work involved in making great things happen. He knows the importance of hard work and determination and was able to prove himself through cycling at a high level and by learning how to develop applications.

When not programming or outdoors cycling, camping, canoing or walking his dog you might find Tom hanging out with friends enjoying a few brews.
